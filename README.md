## Like Stardew Valley
HI! Because most of the games I created were under NDA or in collaboration with other developers, I cannot share the source code. My intention with this project is to create a simple project for my portfolio using only free assets that I can share on GitHub.

I'm adopting Stardew Valley-style gameplay, where you can buy/sell crops and plant/harvest them. I also included a store to buy clothes and an inventory where you can switch between them.

For this project, I employed approaches and coding methodologies that I would only use on a large project! For example, all buttons are stored in arrays so that if the designer want to add more buttons, they may do so without modifying any code!

## Key features:
- New input system!
- ScriptableObjects with inheritance logic
- Dictionary for the inventory
- Events to communicate between codes
- Cinemachine pretty camera transition
- 2DRaycast and colliders layer mask
- Tooltip over the button
- DOTween for animations
- Trello for project management [https://github.com/users/leodecm3/projects/2/views/1](https://github.com/users/leodecm3/projects/2/views/1)
